## Reflections

Getting Started with TypeScript taught me the basics of TypeScript: what TypeScript is, how to compile TypeScript files<br>
Declare Variable Types in TypeScript taught me how to declare variables in TypeScript, what types there are in TypeScript.<br>
Implement interfaces in TypeScript explained what interfaces are in TypeScript, how to declare and extend them.<br>
Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript taught how to use types for functions, that in TypeScript there are 3 types of parameters for a function, how to use aliases and interfaces with functions.<br>
Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript explained how to use TypeScript with classes, what static properties are, how that extends one class with another.<br>
Generics in TypeScript taught how to use generics in functions, class, interfaces.<br>
Access external libraries from TypeScript taught how to work in TypeScript with modules, external type libraries, and organize your code correctly<br>
Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript taught what namespaces are, how to implement namespaces, the differences between modules and namespaces.<br>
In general, this course helped me learn about such a language as typescript, what it is needed for, and how to work with it. Examples allow you to see theoretical terms in use, and tasks after the topic help you consolidate the material you have learned.
